# SysLens

A Windows system inspector built with WPF on .NET 10. It graphs any hardware sensor it can read and shows
where disk space goes and how USB devices are wired together, with an AI assistant that explains any folder,
file, device or hub you point it at.

## Features

### Hardware Monitor

- **Every sensor** – CPU, graphics cards, motherboard, drives, network adapters, fan controllers, power supplies
  and batteries through LibreHardwareMonitor, plus RAM use, listed by device and kind with their live values and a
  search. Network adapters are listed while they are up and have an address. Memory modules' own temperature
  sensors are not read: they are reached over SMBus, which RGB memory controllers hold for long stretches.
- **Drives** – one per disk Windows numbers, as Task Manager lists them, named with its drive letters
  (Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 2TB (C: D:)) and in drive letter order. Active time, read speed and write speed come
  from the counters Windows keeps for Task Manager, so drives behind Intel RST and RAID volumes have them too. A
  RAID volume holds the drives it is made of, each named with its controller port, when the RAID driver reports
  them through CSMI, as Intel RST does; otherwise those drives are listed on their own.
- **Frame rate** – the frame rate and frame time RivaTuner Statistics Server measures for the 3D application it
  last saw in front, or for the busiest one while SysLens is in front. SysLens reads them from RTSS's shared
  memory; it injects nothing into games.
- **Graphs** – tick a sensor to graph it and drag a graph to move it. A graph is titled as the sensor tree names
  it, the sensor and its group (CPU Package - Temperatures), over its device. It holds the last five minutes with
  the lowest, average and highest reading, and shows the reading under the pointer. Lines are coloured by height:
  violet at the bottom of the axis through blue, green and yellow to red at the top. **Clear history** empties
  them.
- **Saved layout** – the graphs shown and their order are written to `SysLens.settings.json` next to
  `SysLens.exe` on every change, and nowhere else. `publish.bat` keeps that file when it rebuilds `publish`.
- **Defaults** – sensors you have not ticked or cleared follow an MSI Afterburner on-screen display: CPU
  temperature, power, clock (the fastest core, Core Max) and usage; for each GPU its temperature, power, power
  percent, core and memory clocks, usage and memory used; RAM used; frame rate and frame time. **Reset to
  defaults** forgets the graphs added, removed or moved.
- **PawnIO** – CPU temperature, power and clocks and motherboard sensors are read through the PawnIO driver.
  While it is missing the tab offers **Install PawnIO**, which installs it with winget (`namazso.PawnIO`).
  LibreHardwareMonitor does not yet recognise every motherboard's sensor chip; such a board lists no sensors.
- The tab comes first and opens with SysLens; every sensor is read once a second until SysLens closes.

### Disk

- **Multi-drive scanning** – tick any number of drives and scan them in parallel.
- **Size tree** – every folder shows its total size, share of the parent and file count, sorted largest
  first. Files inside a folder are listed on demand.
- **Complete results** – runs elevated and enables the backup privilege, so protected folders are read
  too. Junctions, symlinks and mounted volumes are not followed, so nothing is counted twice.
- **Quick actions** – open in Explorer (files open with the file selected) or copy the full path.

### USB

- **Device tree** – every USB device and hub under each root hub, built from the Plug and Play parent
  links. Interface and software children (`&MI_`, `&IG_`, `&LAMPARRAY`) are folded into their device.
  **Show disconnected** adds devices that are not connected now, dimmed, under the hub they were last
  on; when Windows has purged that hub, the device sits at the top level marked "hub chain unknown".
- **Per device** – the name the device reports about itself, VID:PID, status with the Device Manager
  problem code, port location (`Port_#0003.Hub_#0005`) and the instance id, selectable for copying.
- **Hub tiers** – counts the external hubs between the root hub and each node. USB allows five; tier 4
  is shown in yellow and tier 5 and deeper in red, since that is where devices start to drop off.
  Monitors, docks and keyboards often hold internal hubs that count as tiers too.
- **Errors** – devices with a problem code are shown in red with the code and its meaning.
- **History** – devices not connected now, with their last arrival and removal times, latest first.
  A device removed within seconds of arriving is flagged in red: it most likely failed to enumerate.
- **Live** – refreshes by itself shortly after a device is plugged in or removed.

### RGB

The RGB tab is hidden and RGB is not started: `Visibility="Collapsed"` on its `TabItem` in `MainWindow.xaml`,
and `MainWindow.Loaded` does not call `RgbViewModel.StartAsync`. Shown and started, it offers:

- **Every device in one list** – ASUS Aura SDK devices (motherboard, memory, graphics card, ROG displays,
  mice, keyboards and whatever else Armoury Crate's plugins expose) and Windows Dynamic Lighting
  (LampArray) devices, each with its LED count, who drives it now and a live preview of its LEDs.
- **Effects** – off, static, breathing, flash, colour cycle, rainbow wave, gradient, colour shift, comet
  and twinkle, with a colour picker (hue, saturation and value, hex, presets), a second colour where the
  effect uses one, speed, brightness and direction.
- **Sync** – every device follows **All devices** by default, so one set of settings runs on all of them in
  step. Untick **Follow All devices** to give a device its own effect, or **Use for every device** to
  copy its settings to all.
- **Control** – Armoury Crate keeps the Aura devices until you change an effect or press **Take control**.
  **Release to Armoury Crate**, **Refresh** or closing SysLens hands them back. Effects are rendered by
  SysLens, so they run only while it is open. Windows gives Dynamic Lighting devices to SysLens only while
  it is the foreground app; otherwise Windows' own ambient effect runs.

### Ask AI

Right-click any row, or press its **?** button, to ask what it is. For a folder or file: which app owns
it, whether it can be deleted and how to remove it safely. For a USB device or hub: what it is, whether
its place in the hub chain or its status is a problem, and how to fix it. Answers stream in as Markdown
and you can keep the conversation going.

Dark theme with a dark title bar throughout. Panes resized with a splitter, on any tab, keep their size from one
run to the next: it is written to `SysLens.settings.json` with the graphs.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 (1809) or 11
- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (to build) or .NET 10 Desktop Runtime (to run)
- Administrator rights – the app relaunches itself through UAC when started unelevated
- For the AI assistant: an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint and API key
- For RGB: the ASUS Aura SDK, which Armoury Crate installs, and/or Dynamic Lighting devices (Windows 11)
- For the Hardware Monitor: the PawnIO driver for CPU and motherboard sensors (the tab installs it with winget),
  and RivaTuner Statistics Server, which MSI Afterburner installs, for frame rate and frame time

## Build and run

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/silverdragon101195/SysLens.git
cd SysLens
dotnet run -c Release
```

To produce a standalone folder:

```powershell
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -o publish
```

## AI assistant setup

The assistant reads its settings from `Gemini_BYOK.json` next to `SysLens.exe`. This file holds your
API key and is git-ignored.

1. Copy `Gemini_BYOK.example.json` to `Gemini_BYOK.json` in the project folder (the build copies it to
   the output folder) or directly next to `SysLens.exe`.
2. Fill in:
   - `apiKey` – your API key, sent as a `Bearer` token
   - `models[0].url` – base URL of an OpenAI-compatible API; `/chat/completions` is appended
   - `models[0].id` – the model name to request

Only the first entry of `models` is used. Everything else works without this file; only **Ask AI**
needs it.

## Notes

- Builds signed with the Hoshizora code-signing certificate (made by `publish.bat`) add the Hoshizora
  Root CA, embedded in the app, to the machine's Trusted Root Certification Authorities store when it is
  missing there, so Windows can verify the signature; UAC names the publisher from the next launch on.
  Unsigned builds, such as `dotnet run` or a plain `dotnet publish`, never change the certificate store.
- The ASUS Aura SDK loads every vendor's lighting plugin into the process that calls it, so SysLens runs
  it in a child process (`SysLens.exe --aura-host`). A failing plugin ends only that process; when SysLens
  exits, even abnormally, the child hands the devices back to Armoury Crate and exits too. Its first device
  scan can take up to a minute while the plugins load.
- Sizes are logical file sizes, not size on disk.
- The AI sees only the path, size and largest contents of a disk item, never file contents. For a USB
  device it sees the name, VID:PID, status, port location and hub chain, never the instance id, which
  can carry the device's serial number.
- AI answers are advice. Review them before deleting anything, and prefer the owning app's settings or
  built-in Windows tools (Disk Cleanup, Storage Sense) for system data.
